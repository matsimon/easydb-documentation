# Welcome to the easydb documentation

## General

easydb is a flexible web application that allows customers to manage data and information for images and multimedia. easydb has a wide range of possible applications and is often used as a pure image database or for uniform media management for e.g. photos, information, videos, PDFs, office-files and metadata.

This document describes in general the concepts and mechanisms required for easydb use. Under [Solutions](solutions) you can find information on prefabricated solutions. Individual documentation for instances with customer-specific requirements can be ordered additionally.
