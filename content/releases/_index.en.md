# Releases

easydb is regularly updated with new functions, error solutions, and overall improvements

> **Please note that from July 2018 we will change our release cycle from two to three weeks.**

* A new version is prepared every 2 weeks and, - if appropriate for customers - published, and is then ready to be updated.
* Bug fixes can create additional versions (also called "patches").

## Update

Updating is the same as the first steps of the [installation process](../sysadmin/installation). Unless you have an active support contract, this task and responsibility of the customer.

easydb instances on our own servers, including tests and presentations, are updated by us.

- [Version 5.40](5.40/)
