### Server

> IMPORTANT NOTE: The namespace of the XML export has changed. If you use it e.g. for automatic post-editing using XSLT, you must change the old value `http://schema.programmfabrik.de/easydb-data/1.0` to the new value `https://schema.easydb.de/EASYDB/1.0/objects/`.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: Many of the included plugins are now enabled by default. If you have already activated one of these [Extension-Plugins](/en/sysadmin/installation/plugin/custom-data-type/), this will cause problems when starting the server. In this case, you can resolve it with the following options:
> * Disable the included base plugin with [plugins/enabled-](/en/sysadmin/installation/plugin/). For example, if the `extension.custom-data-type-link` plugin is used, `base.custom-data-type-link` must be disabled.
> * Deactivate the configured extension plugin. If this extension plugin is only used because it has not yet been supplied by easydb, this option is the best choice.

* Fallback in `_standard` using object ID is only output for the first data language.
* Removed `ez-standard-missing` marker class from `_standard`.
* Removed support for `elasticsearch` type in search/aggregation.
* Highlighting removed for linked objects autocompletion. It caused performance collapses in some configurations.

* Empty columns in CSV export are removed.
* The CSV export now provides more information for linked record.
* Fixed `_format` in `GET /api/v1/db`, when `long` has been requested.
* Namespace of XML export has been changed.
* Configuration of custom data types in plugin description has been changed, plugins may have to be fixed.
* Custom events can be defined in plugin description. The support for generic server configuration in plugin description (`yaml_config`) has been removed and raises an error on usage.
* On new installations all file types are allowed for upload by default.
* Translations for tables and column names can now be displayed in error messages.
* Handling of custom data types in CSV export improved.

## Version 5.19

*Published on 27/09/2017*

With this release, easydb has switched to a new version of the Elasticsearch software. The change is done automatically when updating the docker containers, but there is a setting that has to be changed on system administration level, as it is not possible to change it via updated docker images:

The value for the [sysctl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl)-key [vm.max_map_count](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html) needs to be increased:
```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
This can be set in the [Start- Script for Elasticsearch-Container](/en/sysadmin/installation) or via the instruments used in the Linux distribution (`sysctl. conf`).

The update to the new Elasticsearch version also requires a re-indexing, which is why the operation of larger databases may be interrupted for several hours.

* Optional batch and version detection for files during manual upload
* Improved memory management
