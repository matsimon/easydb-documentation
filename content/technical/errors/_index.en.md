# Errors

Errors are identified by their code and belong to one of three different realms:

| Name               | Description   |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `realm`            | error realm (string): **server**, **api**, **user** |
| `code`             | error code (string): identifier and CSV key for the error |
| `parameters`       | parameters for the error (map string &#8614; string, optional): only for user errors that require parameters |
| `description`      | error description (string, optional): only for server and API errors |
| `uuid`             | internal error UUID (string, optional): only for server errors |

# <a name="api"></a> API Errors

The requester made an error using the API. Normally it is a syntax error, such as a type mismatch or
something missing. The response HTTP status code is 400.

The error `code` begins with "error.api" and represents a specialized class of API errors.
The error `description` is a text in English.

Example:


{{< include_json "./example_api.json" >}}


Currently supported API errors are:

- error.api.generic: API errors that do not fit into the other categories
- error.api.invalid_request_method: API call does not support the request method
- error.api.invalid_content: The request content is invalid (bad content-type, empty body...)
- error.api.invalid_api: The API call is invalid (for example: /api/foo)
- error.api.attribute_expected: An attribute was expected in a JSON definition
- error.api.type_mismatch: The type of an attribute is wrong
- error.api.invalid_value: The value of an attribute is wrong
- error.api.positional_parameter_expected: A positional parameter is expected
- error.api.attribute_not_accepted: An attribute provided by the user is not accepted
- error.api.invalid_maskset: The provided maskset is malformed
- error.api.eas: A 400 error from EAS occurred
- error.api.suggest_lock_taken: API Call tried to rebuild the suggest index while it was already building





# <a name="server"></a> Server errors

An internal server error occurred which prevented the fulfilment of the request.
The response HTTP status code is 500.

The error `code` begins with "error.server" and the `description` is a text in English.
Server errors also provide the parameter `uuid`, which can be used to retrieve the error details using
[/api/server/error](/en/technical/api/server).

Example:


{{< include_json "./example_server.json" >}}


Currently supported server errors are:

- error.server.generic: for unexpected errors from inside easydb
- error.server.database: for unexpected errors caused by the database
- error.server.elasticsearch: for unexpected errors caused by Elasticsearch
- error.server.eas: for unexpected errors caused by EAS
- error.server.internal_file_error: for unexpected file operation errors




# User errors

User errors are errors that can be triggered by the user. The response HTTP status code is 400.
They are localized (the CSV key is the error code) and may have parameters to be used with the localized texts.

The `code` begins with "error.user". The different user errors are discussed in more detail below.

Example:


{{< include_json "./example_user.json" >}}
