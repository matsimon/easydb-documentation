# Retrieve collection

    GET /api/v1/collection/<id>?token=<token>
    GET /api/v1/collection/uuid/<uuid>?token=<token>

Retrieves information about a collection.

The system provides one top level Root-Collection which can be used to set top level rights. The top level Root-Collection is not included in searches and object output.

## Path parameters

Depending on the call, the collection ID or UUID must be provided.

|   |   |

| `id`   | Collection ID (integer) |
| `uuid` | Collection UUID (text) |

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|

## Output

A [collection](/en/technical/types/collection).

## Permissions

The user must own the collection or have the `bag_read` right for it
(see [rights management](/en/technical/rightsmanagement)).

## HTTP status codes

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 200 | Success |

# Retrieve collections

    GET /api/v1/collection/list[/<id>]?token=<token>[&offset=<offset>][&limit=<limit>]

# Create or update collection

    PUT  /api/v1/collection?token=<token>
    POST /api/v1/collection/<id>?token=<token>

Creates a new collection (PUT) or updates a collection (POST).

## Path parameters

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `id` | Collection ID (integer) |

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `token` | Session token acquired with [/api/v1/session](/en/technical/api/session) |

## Input

A [collection](/en/technical/types/collection).

## Output

The [collection](/en/technical/types/collection) that was created / updated.

## Collection sharing

Collection sharing is accomplished by providing special "who" entries in the collection ACL (see [user (short format)](/en/technical/types/user)):

- "email" users are identified by the e-mail provided and, if not, automatically generated (the user may specify a `frontend_language` for e-mail users)
- "collection" users are automatically generated using the secret provided: if the secret exists an error is returned

The collection ACL has a special attribute "send_email_notification" that can be used to send an e-mail when the ACL is updated.


{{< include_json "./share.json" >}}


## Permissions

The user must own the collection or have the `bag_read` right for it

- the `bag_write` right for the collection, if it is an update (POST)
- the `bag_acl` right if any rights management attribute (\*) is updated
- the `bag_create` right for the parent collection (PUT)
- if the collection is owned by the user, `bag_write` and `bag_acl` are not needed
- if the parent collection is owned by the user, `bag_create` is not needed

System collections cannot be created, but they can be updated. Only the following parameters are allowed to be modified:

- rights management attributes (this requires the `system.rights_management` right)
- `create_object` attributes

(\*) The following attributes are in the rights management group:
`_acl`, `_private_acl`.

# Splice collection objects

    POST /api/v1/collection/splice/<id>

Perform a splice operation with the collection objects.

A splice operation removes a given range of objects, and appends a given set of objects to the collection. The range can be specified by giving a starting **index** and a **count** of objects to be removed.

If no **index** is specified, no objects will be removed before new objects are appended. If **count** is not set, all objects from the start index are removed.

If **index** and **count** are not specified, no objects are removed.

### Handling of existing objects

If any of the new collection objects in **objects** are already in the collection, they will be moved from their current position in the collection to a new position at the end, according to the sorting of the appended objects.
