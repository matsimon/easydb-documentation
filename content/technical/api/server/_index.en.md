# Retrieve status information about the server
    GET /api/v1/plugin/base/server/status?token=<token>

Retrieves status information about a the server, including information about external components such as EAS and Elasticsearch.

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `token` | Session token acquired with [/api/v1/session](/en/technical/api/session) |

## Output

The status information is saved in a JSON object. It contains the current server time and four groups of information.

```json
{
  "info_groups": [
    {
      "name": "system",
      "info": [ ... ]
    },
  {
      "name": "index",
      "info": [ ... ]
    },
  {
      "name": "eas",
      "info": [ ... ]
    },
  {
      "name": "elasticsearch",
      "info": [ ... ]
    }
  ],
  "_server_time": "2018-05-25T02:28:00+02:00"
}
```

The information is saved in a map, with an array `data` that contains the values, and an optional object `headers` that contains the corresponding header names.

```json
{
  "type": "2d-map",
  "name": "indexer_stats_by_status",
  "headers": {
    "values": [
      "total"
    ],
    "name": "status"
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "values": [
        12
      ],
      "type": "integer",
      "name": "count"
    },
    {
      "values": [
        5.3
      ],
      "type": "string",
      "name": "percent"
    }
  ]
}
```
