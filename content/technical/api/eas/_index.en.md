# Insert an asset

    POST /api/v1/eas/put?token=<token>

Upload a new asset.

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `token` | Session token acquired with [/api/v1/session](/en/technical/api/session) |
| `mapping` | use given metadata mapping to populate record with metadata from asset (optional, requires `mask`) |
| `mask` | mask to use when preparing record from metadata (optional, see `mapping`) |
| `objecttype` | object type to use if `mask` is `_all_fields` (optional, see `mask`) |
| `check_for_duplicates` | if set to "1" or "true", assets with the same checksum are returned in the `_duplicates` array |
| `skip_extension_check` | if set to "1" or "true", the check for file extensions is skipped |

## Input

The asset is provided in the request body (`multipart/form-data`).
The request is redirected to EAS [/api/v1/put](http://docs.easydb.de/latest-stable/system/eas/api/put/).

The name of form parameter containing the file does not matter, only a `filename` option in the enclosed `Content-Disposition` header is expected. One request must not contain more than one file upload form fields.

## Output

An array containing [Asset](/en/technical/types/asset) objects is returned. For now there is exactly one object in response.

```js
[
  {
    "_id": 1000481951,
    "compiled": "png image, 300 x 90 @ 8 bit, 8.5 kB",
    "class": "image",
    "extension": "png",
    "class_extension": "image.png",
    "filesize": 8714,
    "technical_metadata": { … },
    "versions": { … }
  }
]
```

## Permissions

The user must be authenticated. The base config defines restrictions for asset upload:

- a global file size limit (optional)
- a file size limit per class (optional)
- a whitelist of allowed file extensions per class (except for the class "other")
- a flag "allow_all": when set, all extensions are allowed, regardless of the "extensions" list

## HTTP status codes

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | [API error](/en/technical/errors): something is malformed |
| 400 | [Session Not Found](/en/technical/errors): session not found fot `token` |
| 400 | [Not Authenticated](/en/technical/errors): session is not authenticated |
| 400 | [Upload Limit Exceeded](/en/technical/errors): a file size limit has been exceeded |
| 400 | [Upload Type Not Allowed](/en/technical/errors): the file type is not allowed |
| 500 | [Server error](/en/technical/errors): internal server error |


# Insert an asset from an external URL

    POST /api/v1/eas/rput?token=<token>&filename=<filename>&url=<url>

Asynchronously fetches a file from an HTTP or HTTPS URL.

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `token` | Session token acquired with [/api/v1/session](/en/technical/api/session) |
| `url` | HTTP or HTTPS URL to fetch the asset from. The URL is checked synchronously, but the file is fetched later. |
| `filename` | filename to use as "original filename". This parameter is currently mandatory. |

## Output

An array containing [Asset](/en/technical/types/asset) objects is returned. For now there is exactly one object in response. As the actual file is fetched later, only a minimal set of information is available directly.

## Permissions

The user must be authenticated. Due to technical limitations the configured upload restrictions (type check, size limit; see `/api/v1/eas/put` above) are not enforced.

## HTTP status codes

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | [API error](/en/technical/errors): something is malformed |
| 400 | [Session Not Found](/en/technical/errors): session not found fot `token` |
| 400 | [Not Authenticated](/en/technical/errors): session is not authenticated |
| 500 | [Server error](/en/technical/errors): internal server error |

### API Error when the given URL is not found

If the resource at the URL `url` is not available, an API Error (`eas_http_404`) is thrown:

```json
{
    "realm": "user",
    "code": "error.user.eas_http_404",
    "parameters": {
        "url": "http://example.foo"
    }
}
```

# Get asset information

    GET /api/v1/eas?token=<token>&ids=<ids>[&format={status|short|long}][&metadata_profile=<...>|&metadata_objecttype=<...>]

Get information available and accessible for an asset / several assets.

## Query String

|   |   |
|---|---|
| `token` | Session token acquired with [/api/v1/session](/en/technical/api/session) |
| `ids` | A JSON integer list containing the asset ids  |
| `format` | This arguments controls how much information is retrieved. It defaults to `long` |
| `mapping` | use given metadata mapping to populate record with metadata from asset (optional, requires `mask`) |
| `mask` | mask to use when preparing record from metadata (optional, see `mapping`) |
| `objecttype` | object type to use if `mask` is `_all_fields` (optional, see `mask`) |
| `check_for_duplicates` | if set to "1" or "true", assets with the same checksum are returned in the `_duplicates` array |

## Output

A JSON object containing entries for each requested ID. Each entry contains different data depending on the chosen format:

*All formats:*

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `id` | The asset ID |
| `versions` | An object: `"<version>": { <version-information> }`. If the format is "status", only the status of each version is given |

*Short / Long:*

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `compiled` | Information about the asset type and basic data as string |
| `class_extension` | String containing "\<asset-class\>.\<file-extension\>" |
| `original_filename` | Original filename (not present in "long" format!) |
| `zoomer` | Information needed to retrieve the zoomer version of this asset (object) |

*Only long:*

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `asset_date` | Timestamp for asset date (string in ISO 8601 format) |
| `pages` | Number of pages (integer) |
| `metadata` | Metadata information (*) |

(*) Example of representation of metadata:


{{< include_json "./get.json" >}}


## Permissions

If the asset is linked by a user object, the user must have the permissions required to see
that user object (see [GET /api/v1/db](/en/technical/api/db)).

If the asset is a user picture, the user must have the permissions required to see the
user picture (see [/api/v1/user](/en/technical/api/user). For versions other than "standard", the user
requires the permissions needed to update the user picture.

If the asset is a pool watermark, the user must have the "bag_read" right.
For versions other than "standard", the "bag_write" right is required.

## HTTP status codes

|   |   |
|---|---|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | [API error](/en/technical/errors): something is malformed |
| 400 | [Not Authenticated](/en/technical/errors): session is not authenticated |
| 400 | [Insufficient Rights](/en/technical/errors): no "read" or "mask" right (the error parameters explain which) |
| 500 | [Server error](/en/technical/errors): internal server error |
