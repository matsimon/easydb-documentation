# Pool

A pool is a container for objects. Only objects from an object type with "pool management" are
stored in pools, and they have to be in exactly one pool. The pool can be used to:

- manage object rights using ACLs, tags and transitions
- set a watermark for its objects
- set standard masks for its objects

The pools build a hierarchy, which is represented by the relation `pool._id_parent` in the pool
object. When searching pools, easydb offers special attributes relating to the pool hierarchy
(`_has_children`, `_level` and `_path`).

Easydb creates automatically some "system pools". These pools cannot be deleted or moved in the pool
hierarchy (that is, change their `_id_parent`).

There are different formats to present a pool: full, full search, short and short search.

## <a name="full"></a> Full format

This format is used by [/api/pool](/en/technical/api/pool) and contains all attributes that can be set for a pool.
It is intended for administrators and is managed by the right `bag_write`.

[objecttype](/en/technical/types/objecttype).\_id, [mask](/en/technical/types/maskset).mask\_id. If set to **null**, the list is derived from the objecttype.  |

Remarks:

- `_id` has to be set for POST operations
- for the meaning of `_tags`, `_private_tags` and `_compiled_tags`, see [tag management](/en/technical/tagmanagement)
- the field `_private_acl` is not available for the root pool
- for each objecttype, if `_standard_masks` contains a subset of all masks, only these will be indexed

Notice that all pools must have a valid `_id_parent` (except for the root pool, which is a system pool).

## <a name="full_search"></a> Full search format

This format is used when searching pools. The column "Search" specifies the search type that can be used (see [/api/search](/en/technical/api/search)).
For fields that are already present in the full format a description is not provided.
This format is intended for all users when they need to view or choose a pool and is managed by the right `bag_read`.

## <a name="short"></a> Short format

The short format is used to render pools inside user objects and other pools.
If the attribute referencing this pool is marked as writable, `pool._id` is writable. The other fields are readable-only.

It contains the following attributes:

| Name                             | |
|----------------------------------|---|
| `_basetype`                      | |
| `_path` (pools in short format)  | |
| `pool`                           | |
| &#8614; `_id`                    | |
| &#8614; `_id_parent`             | |
| &#8614; `name`                   | |

The pools inside `_path` do not have a `_path` themselves.

## <a name="short_search"></a> Short search format

This format is used when searching objects using the fields of their linked pools.
The column "Search" specifies the search type that can be used (see [/api/search](/en/technical/api/search)).
For fields that are already present in the short or full search format a description is not provided.

| Name                             | Description | Search        |
|----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `_basetype`                      |             |               |
| `_level`                         |             | Number        |
| `_path` (pools in short format)  |             | Number (`_path.pool._id`) |
| `pool`                           |             |               |
| &#8614; `_id`                    |             | Number        |
| &#8614; `_id_parent`             |             | Number        |
| &#8614; `_version`               |             | Number        |
| &#8614; `name`                   |             | L10n          |

The pools inside `_path` do not have a `_path` themselves.
